                Currently we encourage only job seekers / candidates who lost their jobs in the pandemic scenario. Referrals should be verified via Linkedin profiles. (Click Linkedin Connect-> Save profile as PDF-> Refer). As a community, it will be a win-win situation for all of us if we can support and make the future safe for one another. Help them to resume their career by referring. #refer2resume</p>
